# Tree-chan Incident

My project idea is a Danmaku+Gachapon game. It will serve as a way to promote the major project as well as provide an entertaining game for people to play.  In the game, you play as Tree-chan, a forest spirit. There are five different bosses that you must fight, all based around substances that harm the environment (e.g. Smoke-chan for air pollution, Sonic-chan for sound pollution). During these fights, you play a danmaku battle against each boss. During the fight, occasionally there will be a Gacha Capsule dropped. If you grab it and win the battle, you can open the Capsule and a randomised seed will drop. During the battle, points will also drop.  You can spend these points to level up your seeds, which will hatch into other forest spirits that you can use in battle. Each spirit has a different bullet type and bomb type. The goal of the game is to hatch at least one of every seed type in order to repopulate the land with trees.
